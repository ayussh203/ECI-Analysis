                <p class="Abstract-Content"> Lok Sabha Elections
                    are a great ordeal in India. The elections of 2024 was held in 7 phases, starting from April 19,
                    with results released on June 4. Polling is done through EVM machines in India, and all citizens above 
                    the age of 18 are requested to participate.</p>
                </p>
                <p class="Abstract-Content">
                    The task at hand was to scrape data from the official ECI website and draw certain insights from the data gathered. I used Python Libraries like BeautifulSoup for scraping, 
                    and Selenium for automation of user behavior for different navigation, loops, and effective scraping. I also used other 
                    libraries to manipulate data, stored in the form of CSV files, and to visualize them. I used Tableau, primarily to 
                    create interactive visualizations to demonstrate the insights and trends I was able to derive.
                </p>
                <p class="Abstract-Content">Thus, this report contains the methodology used to gather the data, preprocessing steps, and finally the visualizations
                    and insights derived from the said data. The primary reason for making this web-based report was to utilize 
                    Tableau's embed feature to make use of its interactive visualization designs. </p>

                <p class="Problem_Statement-Content">In recent years, the complexity and volume of electoral data have significantly
                    increased. This influx makes it imperative to develop robust methodologies for data collection, processing, and 
                    visualization. The goal of visualization - is obviously to derive information and insights, not usually identifiable 
                    by directly looking at the data.

                <p class="Problem_Statement-Content">
                    The goal of this project is to gather, process, and analyze electoral data from various states in India to 
                    derive meaningful insights that can aid political analysts, researchers, and the general public in understanding 
                    voting patterns, party dominance, and electoral dynamics across the country.

                <p class="Problem_Statement-Content">
                    A combination of Web-Scraping using Selenium and BeautifulSoup; preprocessing methods using different python libraries;
                    visualizations using Tableau, and representation of the report using Front-End Web Development; was utilized in successfully 
                    completing this project.

                <p class="Methodology-Content">A) For the National Seat Distribution of the parties, the table was hosted on this 
                    <a href="https://results.eci.gov.in/PcResultGenJune2024/index.htm">url.</a> Scraping this 
                    table was relatively easy, using BeautifulSoup.</p>
                    <p class="Methodology-Content">The specific script can be found in the file "Initial.py"</p>
                    <p class="Methodology-Content">=> Here is a screenshot of the code: 
                        <img src="pictures_HTML/pic1.png"></p>
                <p class="Methodology-Content">B) For seat distribution of every state, I had to automate the 
                    WebScraping behaviour. Using Selenium to mimic user interaction with the website, I had 
                    to select the states from the dropdown and scrape the table on the new website which is 
                    generated, and then return to the previous page again to select the next option and repeat 
                    the scraping process.
                </p>
                <p class="Methodology-Content">This Specific script can be found in "drop_down.py"

                </p>
                <p class="Methodology-Content">C) For every party in every state, I also scraped the details 
                    about which constituency the party has managed to secure a seat in, the candidate's name, 
                    the total votes he/she has received, and the margin of their votes. This was by far the 
                    toughest script I have written, due to loops, multiple go-back statements, and refetching
                    due to StaleElement errors. It obviously required a lot of space and time.
                    The script generates a directory of each state, along with individual csv files for each party.

                <p class="Methodology-Content">
                    B) I also created a list containing parties who have gathered the most seats in every state.
                    This was imperative to visualize the majority in each state, and its effect on the 
                    National Seat distribution.

                <p class="Methodology-Content">
                    C) Finally, to see the Top performers in every state I made a script. Additionally, if there 
                    are ties in the number of seats, then all parties with the same number of seats are included in the
                    file.

                    The scraped and processed data was used to visualize data using different charts.
                    Tableau was a really helpful tool in making interactive dashboards, and it made

                    Using the above Visualization, we can successfully derive two interesting points.
                </p>
                <p class="Insights-Content">
                    I] There are 6 states where BJP is leading, INC is second; with respect to the total seats 
                    won in each state. Along with this, there are 3 states where BJP and INC are tied with equal
                    number of seats.
                    <br>
                    II] There are 5 states where INC has a majority.
                    <br>
                </p>
                    <p style="font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-weight:900">=> Therefore, We can conclude that the Indian National Congress (INC) is not a secondary 
                    option to the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), as some might interpret. Instead, the INC is 
                    a significant contender in its own, gaining second position overall by winning in various
                    constituencies.</p>

                    Thus, we see the trends in the Lok Sabha Elections in the year 2024, and derive certain 
                    insights, with the help of interactive visualizations. The visualizations build in tableau
                    are embedded to give users the ability to interact with the dashboard and understand the 
                    distribution of seats and votes in state, leading up to the national seat statistics.

                <p class="Conclusion-Content">
                    This task thus, required the use of various tools, a comprehensive study of election results,
                    and the structure of the ECI Website.
